                    <li>Upon reading this pillar, it dawned on me that I could do well with a mentor. With me 
                        already being open to learning from others and having an insatiable appetite for reading, A true
                    mentor is something that I lack.</li>
                    <li> Having a mentor would help to broaden my range of knowledge and also the rate of intake.
