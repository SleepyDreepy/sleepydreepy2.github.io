        <h1>Theme And features</h1>
        <p>Below is an explanation of the theme of the website along with it's features</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="dev_col">
                <h3>Theme</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The website was created with the theme "Living Contradiction" in mind</li>
                    <li>The background of the webpages is a character called "Monokuma" from the popular anime/game Danganronpa.
                         This character is an enigma in and of itself as it is a cute teddy bear that wishes for nothing but 
                         the world's despair.
                    </li>
                    <li>This is perfect for the website because people will subconsciously think that this portfolio would take 
                        on a darker tone. This would play into thinking that my personality test would bear much darker fruit.
                    </li>
                    <li>The colors used, red, black and white, aid in giving off the feeling of a living contradiction.</li>
                    <li>The target audience for this website are people between the ages of 16-25</li>
                </ul>
